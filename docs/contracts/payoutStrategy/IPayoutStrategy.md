# IPayoutStrategy





Defines the abstract contract for payout strategies for a round. Any new payout strategy would be expected to extend this abstract contract. Every PayoutStrategyImplementation contract would be unique to RoundImplementation and would be deployed before creating a round. Functions that are marked as `virtual` are expected to be overridden by the implementation contract. - updateDistribution - payout

*- Deployed before creating a round  - Funds are transferred to the payout contract from round only during payout*

## Methods

### ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE

| protocol | uint256 | undefined |
| pointer | string | undefined |

### init

```solidity
function init() external nonpayable
```

Invoked by RoundImplementation on creation to set the round for which the payout strategy is to be used




### isDistributionSet
