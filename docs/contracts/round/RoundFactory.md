# RoundFactory





Invoked by a RoundOperator to enable creation of a round by cloning the RoundImplementation contract. The factory contract emits an event anytime a round is created which can be used to derive the round registry.

*RoundFactory is deployed once per chain and stores a reference to the deployed RoundImplementation.RoundFactory uses openzeppelin Clones to reduce deploy costs and also allows upgrading RoundImplementationUpdated.This contract is Ownable thus supports ownership transfership*

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize() external nonpayable
```

constructor function which ensure deployer is set as owner




### nonce

```solidity
function nonce() external view returns (uint256)
```

Nonce used to generate deterministic salt for Clones




#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### owner

```solidity
function owner() external view returns (address)
```



*Returns the address of the current owner.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | undefined |

### renounceOwnership

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() external nonpayable
```



*Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call `onlyOwner` functions. Can only be called by the current owner. NOTE: Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby disabling any functionality that is only available to the owner.*


### roundImplementation

```solidity
function roundImplementation() external view returns (address)
```

Address of the RoundImplementation contract




#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | undefined |

### transferOwnership

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external nonpayable
```



*Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`). Can only be called by the current owner.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newOwner | address | undefined |

### updateAlloSettings

```solidity
function updateAlloSettings(address newAlloSettings) external nonpayable
```

Allows the owner to update the allo settings contract.



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newAlloSettings | address | New allo settings contract address |

### updateRoundImplementation

```solidity
function updateRoundImplementation(address payable newRoundImplementation) external nonpayable
```

Allows the owner to update the RoundImplementation. This provides us the flexibility to upgrade RoundImplementation contract while relying on the same RoundFactory to get the list of rounds.



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newRoundImplementation | address payable | New RoundImplementation contract address |
